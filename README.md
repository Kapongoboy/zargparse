# Zargparse

Zargparse is a simple command line argument parser loosely modelled after the Python argparse module.
While the zig standard library continues to mature and stabilize, and the community irons out the goto
tools, this will be the module I will be using in my own projects for argument parsing until then.

As such it is continously a work in progress, and I will be adding features as I need them.

You can run the tests with `zig build test` to ensure the current commit works.

Simiarly to other projects if there is a version I feel qualifies for a release I will tag it.

Thank you for reading and good luck.
